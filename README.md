# Online-Food-Ordering-website
Online food ordering is the process of ordering food from a website .The product can be either ready-to-eat food (e.g., direct from a certified home-kitchen, restaurant) or food that has not been specially prepared for direction consumption (e.g., vegetables direct from a farm/garden, frozen meats. etc).The aim of developing Online Food Ordering system project is to replace the traditional way of taking orders with computerized system. Another important reason for developing this project is to prepare order summary reports quickly and in correct format at any point of time when required.
