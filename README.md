# Online-Food-Ordering-website[DBMS project]
The aim of developing an Online Food Ordering system project is to replace the traditional way of taking orders and managing orders with a computerized system. Another important reason for developing this project is to prepare order summary reports quickly and in the correct format at any point in time when required.
